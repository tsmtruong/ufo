# The Truth Is Out There

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpsite using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and bootstrap. The website contains self reported UFO sightings across the United States. It also allows the end-users to filter out data by date, city, state, or shape.

# Results

The website is quite straight forward there is the banner with the name of the website at the top of the screen, followed by some articles about UFOs in a section named UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?. Finally you reach an extensive table of self reported UFO sightings in the United States. On the left hand side of the screen there are five search parameters to filter all of the search.

The first filterable area is the date, if a user wanted to know about UFO settings on a specific date they could enter the date and press enter to narrow down the results to that specific date. (i.e. 1/2/2010)

The second area set up for data entry is the city selection, a user could enter in a city they are interested in to see if there are any UFO sightings in that particular area. (i.e. San Diego)

The third parameter is state, if a user wanted to filter UFO sightings by state they could enter those parameters into the text box and have the results shown that way. (i.e. fl)

The fourth parameter is the country, unfortunately for the user there is obnly one country on the list, the United States, so that search parameter is not helpful but if the list were to ever be updated that would be how a user would narrow down the countries.

The last way of filtering results is by shape, if a user were to spot a shape and wanted to see if that shape had been found or recorded before they could do so with this search parameter.(i.e. triangle)

All of the searches can be executed by pushing the enter key on the user's keyboard.

# Summary

While this website is a completely functional website it is still a very simple webiste that is not very intuitve. One drawback of the website is that it is not very build out, everything is on one page so the information provided is very simple. There are only excerpts of articles and sightings in the United States. That leads me into my first recommendation, scrape or find for more UFO sighting data to make the list more substantial. My other recommedation is to make the website more appealing to the users, there are many functions in html and bootstrap that can be used as well as making the filter area more intuitive where there is only one text entry box with a drop down menu function.
